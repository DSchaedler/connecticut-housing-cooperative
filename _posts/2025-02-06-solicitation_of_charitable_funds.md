Not being able to accept grants or donations would be pretty catastrophic for a cooperative. Part of this project relies on tax exempt statuses, cooperation with Land Banks and public benefit programs, and direct donations.

As defined in the Connecticut Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act (CGS Chapter 419d, Section 21a-175 through 21a-190l):

> The Act defines a charitable organization as "any person who is or holds himself out to be established for any benevolent, educational, philanthropic, humane, scientific, patriotic, social welfare or advocacy, public health, environmental conservation, civic or eleemosynary purpose, or for the benefit of law enforcement officers, firefighters or other persons who protect the public safety.”
>
> "Person” means "an individual, corporation, association, partnership, trust, foundation or any other entity however styled." Organizations that have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from federal taxation under sections 501(c)(3) (charitable, educational, religious, scientific testing) or 501(c)(4) (civic, social welfare) of the Internal Revenue Code are clearly subject to the Act, if they solicit (see Part D). Organizations that have not applied for or received federal tax exemption, or organizations that have received exemption under another category of section 501(c) are also subject to the Act if they engage in any activity that involves the solicitation of contributions.

I think that means a Cooperative Association would be in the clear, especially if it can obtain 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) status.

If it can't, then it can always [accept non-tax deductable donations](https://medium.com/start-coop/how-can-you-accept-donations-and-grants-as-a-cooperative-868c661a95f9). However, grants are still off limits unless coordinated through a [fiscal sponsor](https://medium.com/start-coop/how-can-you-accept-donations-and-grants-as-a-cooperative-868c661a95f9). There are options out there, but it seems like the only way to know for sure is to create the cooperative association, then apply for tax exempt status with all of the correct regulatory agencies.

Raise a glass to the future.
