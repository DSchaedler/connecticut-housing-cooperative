Based on what I can find in Connecticut, it seems like the legal entity required is a Cooperative Association as defined by [Connecticut General Statutes Title 33 Chapter 595.](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/pub/chap_595.htm)

> Three or more persons of lawful age and inhabitants of this state, may, by written articles of association, associate themselves together for the purposes of trade or for carrying on any lawful mercantile, mechanical, manufacturing or agricultural business within this state, and, when such articles of association have been executed and filed in the office of the Secretary of the State, the franchise tax provided by section 33-187 paid to, and such articles of association approved by, said secretary, such persons shall become a corporation and enjoy all the powers and privileges and be subject to all the duties, restrictions and liabilities of other corporations, except so far as such duties, restrictions and liabilities may be limited or enlarged by this chapter.

That means I need at least two more people to agree with me on this. Fine, I can work with that.

> Such association may make its own bylaws.

That's good

> The amount of capital stock of any cooperative association organized under the provisions of this chapter shall be fixed by its articles of association ... The association may increase or diminish the amount and number of shares of such stock

Also good. That means as the Association grows, it can be expanded equally.

> Not later than thirty days after the first meeting of the association, the board of directors shall prepare a report, setting forth the name of the association, the principal office of the association, the names of the respective business and residence addresses of the board of directors and officers of the association, the amount of capital stock, the par value of the shares, and the number of shares issued, together with a statement that such shares are fully paid or, if not fully paid, a statement of the amount payable in respect thereof, which report shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of the State. On or before the tenth day of March annually thereafter, the board of directors shall prepare a report of the facts as they existed on the first day of March and such report shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of the State. Any statement provided for in this section shall be signed and sworn to by a majority of the board of directors.

Okay, so this is the tricky part.

- The association will not have a principal office, so the address of a member will have to suffice.
- The amount of Capital Stock and the par value of the shares will be tricky to determine. Ideally, everyone in the initial association would contribute the same amount. However, this may not be possible.

> On or before the tenth day of March annually thereafter, the board of directors shall prepare a report of the facts as they existed on the first day of March and such report shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of the State. Any statement provided for in this section shall be signed and sworn to by a majority of the board of directors.

Yay! The first compliance reporting requirement! I'm sure these will slow down significantly /s.

> No member of any such cooperative association shall be entitled to more than one vote upon any subject, at any meeting of such association.

Okay, so regardless of the number of shares owned by an individual, their voting rights are the same. It seems to me then that the inital number of shares should be 3, and the par value per share should be $1.

> If the association fails to file the annual report required by section 33-188 or makes an untrue report, the association shall pay to the Secretary of the State fifty dollars for each such failure.

Another reporting requirement, yay!

> There shall be a distribution of the profits or surplus of an association among the member shareholders as is prescribed by the association's bylaws. The board of directors of an association may declare a sum of not more than forty per cent of the net profits or surplus to be appropriated for a contingent or sinking fund, an unallocated reserve fund or a collective account as may be prescribed in the association's bylaws.

Sounds reasonable. What's a "contingent or sinking fund, an unallocated reserve fund or a collective account"? Wait, will this not be a non-profit? Will we not be able to apply for Grants or register to collect charitable donations? That could become a problem in the future. I'll have to investigate further.

Raise a glass to the future.
